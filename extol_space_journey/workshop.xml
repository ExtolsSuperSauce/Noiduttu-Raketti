Works best in 1920x1080 Resolution. MAKE SURE YOUR CONFIG ISN'T MODIFIED! \n\nFly a rocket through Space and [REDACTED] for great and glorious purpose! Find what riches await, and upgrade your rocket to fly higher! \n\nThanks so much to Absent Friend for helping create many of the assets and fix my silly bugs! \nThis mod was a blast to work on, and might be updated after the mod jam! <3 \nAll Audio is from Noita or made by me!
